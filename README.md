# Sparta-Rails-Intro_Homework

## Description

This was a code-along to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPy0GQJLZUM&t=1404s. The objective was to make a simple generic site where you are able to make and see posts.

You are able to add, edit or delete the posts. There is also a comments section for each post and a username authorization system.
